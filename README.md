## Methods Used

- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and preparing healthcare data from `CESR.CSV` for analysis.
- **Feature Selection**: Identifying the most relevant features for clustering through exploratory data analysis.
- **AI Clustering Algorithms**: Applying the KModes clustering algorithm to segment the healthcare data, leveraging libraries such as NumPy, pandas, matplotlib, and sklearn for data manipulation and visualization.
